# Phase 2.4: Core Feature Engineering - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements Phase 2.4 of the "Advanced Framework for On-Chain Behavioral Clustering and Revenue Analysis in Decentralized Finance" project. We will transform the raw interaction data from `interaction_etl.py` into a rich set of behavioral features suitable for machine learning clustering.

## Input Data Structure

From `interaction_etl.py`, we have enriched interaction data with these columns:
- **Transaction Data**: `transaction_hash`, `block_timestamp`, `from_address`, `to_address`, `value`, `receipt_gas_used`, `gas_price`
- **Contract Metadata**: `user_type`, `application`, `protocol_category`, `contract_role`, `label_type`, `etherscan_verified`, `first_block`, `notes`

## Feature Engineering Goals

Transform interaction-level data into user-level behavioral features for clustering:

### 1. **Sub-Group Interaction Counts**
- Count of interactions per user by `protocol_category` (DEX, Lending, Staking, etc.)
- Count of interactions per user by `user_type` (Traders, Liquidity Providers, etc.)
- Count of interactions per user by `application` (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
- Count of unique protocols/applications interacted with

### 2. **Gas Usage Features**
- Total gas used per user (overall and by protocol category)
- Average gas per interaction (overall and by protocol category)
- Gas price behavior (average, median, std dev)
- Gas efficiency metrics (gas per ETH value transacted)

### 3. **Transaction Value Features**
- Total ETH value sent (`msg.value`) per user (overall and by protocol category)
- Average transaction value per interaction
- Value distribution metrics (median, std dev, percentiles)
- Value concentration (Gini coefficient, top 10% of transactions)

### 4. **Basic Temporal Features**
- Recency: Days since last DeFi interaction
- Frequency: Number of active days in the analysis period
- Activity duration: Days between first and last interaction
- Transaction cadence: Average time between transactions
- Activity intensity: Transactions per active day

### 5. **Ratio Features**
- DEX interactions / Total interactions
- Lending interactions / Total interactions
- Staking interactions / Total interactions
- High-value transactions (>1 ETH) / Total transactions
- Gas spent / ETH value transacted

### 6. **Diversity Features**
- Number of unique protocol categories used
- Number of unique applications used
- Protocol diversity index (Shannon entropy)
- Application concentration (Herfindahl index)

### 7. **Risk-Related Features**
- Average gas price relative to network average
- Percentage of high gas price transactions (>90th percentile)
- Interaction with unverified contracts
- Interaction with recently deployed contracts (<30 days old)

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`feature_extractor.py`** - Main orchestration class
2. **`interaction_aggregator.py`** - Aggregate raw interactions by user
3. **`temporal_features.py`** - Time-based behavioral features
4. **`protocol_features.py`** - Protocol-specific interaction patterns
5. **`risk_features.py`** - Risk and sophistication indicators
6. **`feature_validator.py`** - Data quality and validation
7. **`feature_pipeline.py`** - End-to-end pipeline orchestration

## Success Criteria

1. **Data Quality**: >95% of users have complete feature vectors
2. **Performance**: Process 100K users in <10 minutes
3. **Validation**: All features pass statistical sanity checks
4. **Documentation**: Complete feature definitions and interpretations
5. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic results with version control

## Next Phase Integration

The output user feature matrix will feed directly into:
- **Phase 2.5**: Data preprocessing (scaling, outlier handling)
- **Phase 2.6**: Initial clustering experiments
- **Phase 3**: Advanced feature engineering (graph, sequential)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Memory Management**: Process data in chunks for large datasets
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for missing/invalid data
3. **Scalability**: Modular design for easy feature addition/removal
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive checks at each pipeline stage
5. **Monitoring**: Detailed logging for debugging and optimization
