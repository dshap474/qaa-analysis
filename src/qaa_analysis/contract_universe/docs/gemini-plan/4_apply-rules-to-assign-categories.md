Excellent. You've reached the final and most rewarding step. You have the "venues" (contracts) and the "behaviors" (actions), and you have an engine that decodes them in real-time. Now, let's use that data to build persistent user profiles.

Here are the step-by-step instructions for **Step 4: Apply Rules to Assign Categories**.

The goal here is to move from a simple stream of actions to an aggregated, stateful system. When the script sees `User 0x123...` perform a swap, it won't just print it; it will update that user's profile to say, "This user is likely a Trader."

---

### **The Concept: A Scoring and Tagging System**

We will create a simple database (a dictionary in our script) to store a profile for every user address we see. Each profile will contain a set of "tags" or "categories" that describe the user's behavior.

We will define a set of rules (heuristics) to assign these tags. For example:
*   **Rule:** If a user performs more than 5 `swap` actions, tag them as a **"Trader"**.
*   **Rule:** If a user performs at least one `add_liquidity` action, tag them as a **"Liquidity Provider"**.
*   **Rule:** If a user performs a `borrow` action, tag them as a **"Borrower"**.

This approach allows a single user to have multiple tags (e.g., a user can be both a "Trader" and a "Lender").

### **Part A: Setting Up the Profile Management System**

We'll modify our `decode_transactions.py` script to include a system for managing these user profiles.

#### **Step A.1: Initialize the Profile Database**

At the top of your script, after loading the other data, initialize a dictionary to hold the profiles. We'll also add functions to save and load this data so our analysis persists between script runs.

```python
# (Keep all the code from Step 3 here)
# ...

# --- STEP 4: PROFILE MANAGEMENT ---

# This dictionary will hold our user profiles in memory.
# Format: { "user_address": {"categories": set(), "action_counts": {}} }
USER_PROFILES = {}
PROFILES_FILENAME = "user_profiles.json"

def load_profiles():
    """Loads user profiles from a file at the start."""
    global USER_PROFILES
    try:
        with open(PROFILES_FILENAME, 'r') as f:
            # Convert lists back to sets after loading from JSON
            loaded_data = json.load(f)
            USER_PROFILES = {
                addr: {
                    "categories": set(data.get("categories", [])),
                    "action_counts": data.get("action_counts", {})
                } for addr, data in loaded_data.items()
            }
        print(f"âœ… Successfully loaded {len(USER_PROFILES)} user profiles from {PROFILES_FILENAME}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No existing profiles file found. Starting fresh.")
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Warning: Could not decode {PROFILES_FILENAME}. Starting fresh.")

def save_profiles():
    """Saves the current user profiles to a file."""
    # Convert sets to lists for JSON serialization
    serializable_profiles = {
        addr: {
            "categories": list(data["categories"]),
            "action_counts": data["action_counts"]
        } for addr, data in USER_PROFILES.items()
    }
    with open(PROFILES_FILENAME, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(serializable_profiles, f, indent=2)
    print(f"\nðŸ’¾ Saved {len(USER_PROFILES)} profiles to {PROFILES_FILENAME}")

```

---

### **Part B: Defining the Rules Engine**

This is the core logic of Step 4. We'll create a function that takes a user and their action, and updates their profile according to our rules.

#### **Step B.1: Create the `update_user_profile` Function**

This function will contain our heuristics.

```python
def update_user_profile(user_address, action):
    """Updates a user's profile based on a new action."""
    # Ensure the user has a profile entry
    if user_address not in USER_PROFILES:
        USER_PROFILES[user_address] = {
            "categories": set(),
            "action_counts": {}
        }
    
    profile = USER_PROFILES[user_address]

    # Increment the count for this specific action
    profile["action_counts"][action] = profile["action_counts"].get(action, 0) + 1

    # --- HEURISTICS ENGINE: APPLY RULES TO ASSIGN CATEGORIES ---
    
    # Rule for Liquidity Providers
    if action in ["add_liquidity", "remove_liquidity"]:
        profile["categories"].add("Liquidity Provider")

    # Rule for Lenders
    if action in ["supply", "redeem"]:
        profile["categories"].add("Lender")

    # Rule for Borrowers
    if action == "borrow":
        profile["categories"].add("Borrower")

    # Rule for Traders (based on a threshold)
    swap_count = profile["action_counts"].get("swap", 0)
    if swap_count > 5: # Threshold can be adjusted
        profile["categories"].add("Trader")
        
    # Rule for Stakers
    if action == "stake": # Assuming you add a "stake" action to your dictionary
        profile["categories"].add("Staker")

    # You can add many more rules here!
```

---

### **Part C: Integrating into the Decoding Engine**

Now, we need to *call* our new `update_user_profile` function from the `decode_transaction` function we built in Step 3.

#### **Step C.1: Modify `decode_transaction`**

We'll add a call to `update_user_profile` whenever we successfully identify an action. We will focus on the **outcome (events)** as the source of truth.

```python
# --- MODIFY THIS FUNCTION FROM STEP 3 ---

def decode_transaction(tx, contract_address):
    """Decodes a single transaction and updates the user's profile."""
    user_address = w3.to_checksum_address(tx['from'])
    tx_hash = tx['hash'].hex()
    
    try:
        receipt = w3.eth.get_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)
    except Exception as e:
        return # Skip if we can't get the receipt

    if receipt.status == 0:
        return # Skip failed transactions

    # Decode based on events (the outcome)
    for log in receipt.logs:
        if not log['topics']:
            continue
            
        event_selector = log['topics'][0].hex()
        if event_selector in EVENT_SELECTOR_LOOKUP:
            event_details = EVENT_SELECTOR_LOOKUP[event_selector]
            action = event_details['action']
            protocol = event_details['protocol']
            
            # This is the new integration point!
            update_user_profile(user_address, action)
            
            # Optional: Print the update for real-time feedback
            print(f"[ACTION] User {user_address} performed '{action}' on {protocol}.")
            print(f"  -> Profile: {USER_PROFILES[user_address]['categories']}")
```

---

### **Part D: Putting It All Together**

Finally, let's adjust the main execution block to load profiles at the start and save them at the end.

#### **Step D.1: Update the Main Execution Block**

```python
# --- MODIFY THE MAIN EXECUTION BLOCK ---

def process_block(block_number):
    """Fetches a block and analyzes each transaction within it."""
    print(f"\n--- Processing Block: {block_number} ---")
    # (The rest of this function remains the same as in Step 3)
    try:
        block = w3.eth.get_block(block_number, full_transactions=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Could not fetch block {block_number}: {e}")
        return

    for tx in block.transactions:
        if not tx['to']:
            continue
        contract_address = w3.to_checksum_address(tx['to'])
        if contract_address in CONTRACT_LOOKUP:
            decode_transaction(tx, contract_address)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load existing profiles before starting
    load_profiles()
    
    try:
        # Analyze the last 5 blocks as an example
        latest_block = w3.eth.block_number
        for i in range(5):
            process_block(latest_block - i)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # Always save profiles on exit (even if there's an error)
        save_profiles()
```

### **Summary of Your Complete System**

Congratulations! By running this final script, you have a complete, end-to-end system that:

1.  **Discovers** relevant DeFi contracts using factory registries (Step 1).
2.  **Understands** the meaning of on-chain actions using a selector dictionary (Step 2).
3.  **Monitors** the blockchain and decodes relevant transactions in real-time (Step 3).
4.  **Aggregates** user activity into persistent profiles using a rules-based engine, tagging them with behavioral categories like "Trader," "Lender," and "Liquidity Provider" (Step 4).

Your `user_profiles.json` file is now a valuable database that maps addresses to their demonstrated DeFi behaviors, and it will grow and become more accurate every time you run the script.
