Of course. This is an excellent goal and a core task in on-chain analytics. Combining these three data sources is precisely the right way to build a robust system for behavioral mapping.

Here is a framework for how you can best incorporate all three to create specific, high-fidelity user profiles.

### The Conceptual Framework: A 3-Layer Funnel

Think of your process as a funnel that moves from broad discovery to specific action.

1.  **Layer 1: Discovery (The "Where to Look") - Factory Registries**
    *   **Purpose:** To build a comprehensive and dynamic list of all relevant contracts (the "venues" where behavior occurs). You can't just hardcode the top 10 Uniswap pools; you need all of them.
    *   **Action:** Use the `factory_address` and its `event_topic` to query all historical logs. This gives you a complete list of every Pair, Pool, or Market created by that factory. This is your **"Contract Universe."**

2.  **Layer 2: Context (The "What is this Place?") - DeFi App Contracts**
    *   **Purpose:** To categorize the contracts from your universe.
    *   **Action:** When you see a transaction, you check the `to` address against your "Contract Universe." Is it a Uniswap V2 Pair? A Curve V2 Pool? The Aave V3 Lending Pool? This tells you the *environment* in which the user is acting.

3.  **Layer 3: Intent & Outcome (The "What did they do?") - Function & Event Selectors**
    *   **Purpose:** To understand the specific action the user performed. This is the most critical layer for defining behavior.
    *   **Action:** For a given transaction, you inspect the `calldata` for the **function selector** (the user's command) and the logs for the **event selectors** (the recorded outcome). A `swap` selector is fundamentally different from an `addLiquidity` selector.

### A Step-by-Step Methodology

Here is a practical workflow to implement this:

**Step 1: Build Your "Contract Universe" (Offline/Pre-computation)**

1.  **Start with Factories:** Take your list of factory contracts (Uniswap, Curve, etc.).
2.  **Query Logs:** For each factory, use an archive node or indexing service to find all logs matching its creation `event_topic`.
3.  **Extract Child Addresses:** Parse these logs using the `child_slot_index` to extract the address of every pool/pair ever created.
4.  **Add Core Contracts:** Manually add the main, non-factory-created contracts to your list (e.g., Uniswap Routers, Aave/Compound Pools, Lido's Staking contract).
5.  **Categorize:** Store this list of addresses with labels (e.g., `{'0x...': 'Uniswap V2 Pair', '0x...': 'Aave V3 Pool'}`).

**Step 2: Monitor and Decode Live Transactions (Real-time)**

1.  **Listen to the Chain:** Monitor every new block.
2.  **Filter:** Discard any transaction where the `to` address is not in your "Contract Universe."
3.  **Decode:** For the remaining transactions, extract:
    *   `from` address (the user/EOA)
    *   `to` address (the contract they called)
    *   `function_selector` (first 4 bytes of `calldata`)
    *   `event_logs` (specifically the `topic0` of each log)

**Step 3: Apply Heuristics to Assign Behavioral Labels**

This is where you define your categories by combining the layers.

### Defining Behavioral Categories with Heuristics

| Behavior Category | Primary Signal & Heuristics | Key Contracts to Monitor | Key Selectors (Function/Event) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trader / Swapper** | **Frequent `swap` or `exchange` calls.** A user who primarily interacts with DEXs to trade one asset for another. | Uniswap Routers, Curve Pools, Balancer Vault, all DEX pools from factories. | **Function:** `swapExactTokensForTokens`, `exactInputSingle`, `exchange`. <br> **Event:** `Swap` (from Uniswap), `TokenExchange` (from Curve). |
| **Liquidity Provider (LP)** | **Calls to `addLiquidity` and holds LP tokens.** A user who provides capital to DEXs to earn fees. Their actions are infrequent but involve large amounts. | Uniswap Routers, Uniswap V3 NFT Manager, Curve Factories/Pools. | **Function:** `addLiquidity`, `mint` (on NFT Manager), `add_liquidity`. <br> **Event:** `Mint` (Uniswap V2), `IncreaseLiquidity` (V3), `AddLiquidity` (Curve). |
| **Lender** | **Supplying assets to lending protocols.** A user who deposits assets to earn interest, acting as the capital supply side. | Aave Pools, Compound cTokens, Spark Pool. | **Function:** `supply` (Aave V3), `mint` (Compound V2). <br> **Event:** `Supply` (Aave), `Mint` (Compound). |
| **Borrower / Leverage Taker** | **Taking out loans against collateral.** A user who uses lending protocols to borrow assets, often for leverage or other strategies. | Aave Pools, Compound Comptroller. | **Function:** `borrow`. <br> **Event:** `Borrow`. |
| **Liquid Staker** | **Depositing ETH into a liquid staking protocol.** A user who stakes ETH to receive a liquid staking token (LST) like stETH or rETH. | Lido Staking Pool, Rocket Pool Deposit Pool, Frax frxETH Minter. | **Function:** `submit` (Lido), `deposit` (Rocket Pool). <br> **Event:** `Submitted` (Lido), `EtherDeposited` (Rocket Pool), `ETHStaked` (Frax). |
| **Arbitrageur** | **Complex, atomic transactions involving multiple swaps.** This is a pattern, not a single call. Look for multiple `Swap` events within a single transaction, often initiated by a flash loan. | Aave Pools (for flash loans), all DEX pools. | **Pattern:** `flashLoan` call -> multiple `Swap` events -> repayment of loan, all in one transaction. High frequency, small profits. Often uses private relays (Flashbots). |
| **NFT Trader** | **Interacting with NFT marketplaces.** | OpenSea (Seaport), Blur, LooksRare. | **Function:** `fulfillBasicOrder`, `fulfillOrder`. <br> **Event:** `OrderFulfilled`. |

### Putting It All Together: An Example

1.  **Discovery:** Your system queries the Uniswap V2 Factory and discovers a new Pair contract: `0xAE46...`
2.  **Context:** You add `0xAE46...` to your "Contract Universe" with the label `Uniswap V2 Pair`.
3.  **Monitoring:** You see a transaction from user `0x123...` to the Uniswap V2 Router (`0x7a25...`).
4.  **Intent & Outcome:**
    *   The function selector is `0x38ed1739` (`swapExactTokensForTokens`).
    *   The transaction logs show a `Swap` event (`0xd78ad95fa46c994b6551d0da85fc275fe613ce37657fb8d5e3d130840159d822`) emitted from the `0xAE46...` Pair contract.
5.  **Labeling:** Based on the `swap` selector and `Swap` event, you increment the "Trader" score for address `0x123...`. If this user does this frequently, you can confidently assign them the **Trader** behavioral category.
