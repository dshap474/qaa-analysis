# DATA DICTIONARY: DeFi Protocol Contract Inventory by User Archetype

## Overview & Methodology

This data dictionary provides a curated inventory of Ethereum mainnet contract addresses and metadata, categorized by the primary user archetypes they serve. The inventory is designed to support on-chain data analysis, particularly for clustering addresses based on user behavior and protocol interaction, by directly linking contracts to the types of users who interact with them.

**Construction Methodology:**

1.  **Aggregation:** Contract addresses and metadata were gathered from:
    *   Official protocol documentation
    *   Verified smart contract code on Etherscan
    *   Reputable sources like DeFiLlama and CoinGecko

2.  **Verification:** Each address was cross-checked against primary sources (official documentation, GitHub repositories) to ensure it is canonical and currently active on Ethereum mainnet.

3.  **Scope:** The inventory focuses on top DeFi protocols (TVL â‰¥ $250M) and other significant applications across key sectors relevant to the identified user archetypes.

**Key Steps:**

*   **Protocol Selection:** Protocols were selected based on their relevance to core user archetypes, starting with top DeFi protocols by TVL (per DeFiLlama, May 2025) and extending to others that exemplify specific user behaviors (e.g., NFT marketplaces, liquid staking, DAO governance). NFT-specific platforms and major cross-chain bridge contracts on Ethereum (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum bridges) were included where they serve as primary interaction points for specific user types.

*   **Address Collection & Archetype Mapping:** For each protocol, primary Ethereum mainnet contracts were identified and then mapped to the most relevant user archetype(s) based on their function and the typical user behavior they facilitate.
    *   Core logic contracts (often proxied), such as Aave's Pool proxy, Compound's Comptroller, and Uniswap factories/routers.
    *   Token contracts for stablecoins and LSDs (e.g., DAI, USDC, stETH).
    *   Factory/registry contracts that spawn new pools or vaults (e.g., Uniswap/Curve factories, Lido's new V2 router).

*   **Proxy vs. Implementation:** Where proxies are used, the proxy address is listed as canonical (with `label_type: Proxy`), and the implementation address is noted if relevant (e.g., Curve's VotingEscrow proxy and implementation pair). All listed proxies have verified source code via Etherscan's proxy info.

*   **Verification:** Each address is verified as source-code verified on Etherscan (`etherscan_verified: Yes`). Etherscan and block explorers were used to fetch deployment blocks and confirm contract roles (via name tags or code). Official documentation was crucial for verification.

## Metadata Fields

The data dictionary includes the following metadata fields for each contract:

*   **`contract_role`:** Describes the contract's purpose within the protocol and its relevance to the user archetype (e.g., "Pool (LendingPool proxy)" for Aave's main pool proxy, "UniswapV3 Factory").

*   **`label_type`:** Differentiates between proxies and regular contracts. "Proxy" indicates an upgradeable proxy; "Contract" indicates a direct implementation or non-proxy contract.

*   **`first_block`:** The Ethereum block height at which the contract was created. This helps confirm the contract's generation chronology.

*   **`abi_url`:** A reference to the ABI (Application Binary Interface) or source code. Often, the official documentation URL is used as the ABI reference, as Etherscan ABI JSON links are not static without an API.

*   **`notes`:** Captures any relevant nuances (e.g., "deprecated by V3," "example pool").

*   **`event_topic`:** (For Factories) The Keccak-256 hash of the event signature emitted when a child contract is spawned.

*   **`child_slot_index`:** (For Factories) The index of the event parameter containing the child contract's address.

## Function Selectors (Common to many DeFi Protocols)

Common function selectors for user-facing actions (swaps, deposits, borrows) are collated. The 4-byte directory and official ABIs are used to map function signatures to their 4-byte selectors. This aids in decoding transaction data for behavioral analysis.

*   **Uniswap V2/V3:**
    *   `swapExactTokensForTokens` (V2/V3): `0x38ed1739`
    *   `swapETHForExactTokens` (V2): `0xfb3bdb41`
    *   `exactInputSingle` (V3): `0x4118f946`
*   **Aave:**
    *   `deposit`: `0x47e1933a`
    *   `borrow`: `0x89d2d094`
    *   `withdraw`: `0x69bb12e7`
*   **Compound:**
    *   `mint`: `0xa0712d68` (for cTokens)
    *   `redeem`: `0xdb006a75` (for cTokens)
*   **Curve:**
    *   `exchange`: `0x3d00259e` (for stable swaps)

## Token Metadata (Relevant to User Archetypes)

A list of major tokens relevant to these protocols, classified by their role in user archetypes (e.g., stablecoins for "Stablecoin Users," LSDs for "Stakers").

## Data Provenance and Quality

Every contract address is sourced from:

*   Official project documentation or repository (e.g., Aave's address book, Uniswap docs, Lido dev docs).
*   Well-known blockchain data aggregators (DeFiLlama, CoinGecko) for secondary verification.

Unverified forum posts or user-generated lists are avoided unless cross-verified. The exact location in documentation or code commits confirming an address is cited where possible. All Etherscan verification statuses are "Yes," as unverified contracts are intentionally omitted.
