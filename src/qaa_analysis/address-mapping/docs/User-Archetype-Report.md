# Understanding Ethereum User Archetypes: A Behavioral Segmentation Analysis

# ---
# I. Introduction: Navigating the Diverse Ethereum User Landscape
# ---

The Ethereum blockchain has evolved significantly since its inception, transforming from a nascent platform for programmable money into a sprawling digital metropolis. It hosts a diverse array of decentralized applications (dApps) spanning finance, art, gaming, identity management, and more.[^1] This multifaceted nature, often described as "the mother of dApps" [^2], means that users interact with Ethereum for a wide variety of reasons, leading to distinct behavioral patterns. Understanding these user segments is not merely an academic exercise; it is crucial for comprehending the network's economic activity, identifying emerging trends, assessing risks, and fostering a healthier ecosystem.

The platform's open and permissionless design allows anyone to deploy applications, attracting a global user base with varied motivations and levels of technical sophistication.[^3] Consequently, user activity is not monolithic. Instead, specialized behaviors emerge as individuals and entities gravitate towards applications that serve their specific needs—be it a farmer in India seeking access to global financial markets or a collector acquiring unique digital art.[^1] This inherent specialization necessitates a framework for categorizing users to make sense of the vast on-chain data.

Furthermore, different user activities contribute uniquely to Ethereum's economic throughput and present distinct risk profiles. For instance, high-frequency trading in decentralized finance (DeFi) contributes significantly to transaction volume and fee generation but also introduces risks related to market volatility and smart contract exploits.[^4] Conversely, long-term staking of Ether (ETH) contributes to network security but involves different risk considerations, such as validator performance and lock-up periods.[^5] By segmenting users, analysts, developers, and investors can gain a more granular understanding of value flows, identify areas of concentrated risk, and better anticipate how network upgrades or market events might differentially impact various user cohorts. This report aims to identify and characterize these potential user buckets based on their on-chain behavioral signatures.

# II. Foundational Ethereum User Archetypes
# ---

The Ethereum ecosystem is populated by a diverse range of users, each engaging with the blockchain in ways that reflect their specific goals and interests. These interactions leave distinct on-chain footprints, allowing for the identification of several foundational user archetypes.

### A. The DeFi Participant

DeFi participants are primarily motivated by financial objectives, utilizing Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure for activities ranging from simple token swaps to intricate yield optimization strategies. Their on-chain behavior is characterized by interactions with protocols designed for lending, borrowing, trading, and liquidity provision. This financial focus also makes them highly attuned to transaction efficiency (cost and speed) and the inherent risks of the DeFi landscape. The promise of permissionless access to global markets, opportunities to earn interest on holdings, and novel financial instruments are key draws for this segment.[^1]

#### 1. Traders (DEX Users, Arbitrageurs, MEV Searchers)

Traders are a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, engaging in the buying, selling, and swapping of various cryptocurrencies and tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).[^2] Their activities span a spectrum from straightforward token exchanges, such as swapping ETH for a stablecoin on Uniswap[^6], to more complex arbitrage strategies that seek to profit from price discrepancies across different DEXs or liquidity pools. A specialized subset includes Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) searchers, who leverage sophisticated techniques to profit from transaction ordering, often through front-running or sandwich attacks.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Frequent invocation of swap functions on DEX router smart contracts. Examples include `swapExactTokensForTokens` and `swapETHForTokens` on Uniswap V2[^7], or `exactInputSingle` and `exactOutputSingle` on Uniswap V3.[^9]
*   Transactions involving multiple DEX interactions in rapid succession, indicative of arbitrage attempts.
*   High transaction frequency, sometimes coupled with advanced gas price management (e.g., high priority fees) characteristic of MEV activities.[^5]
*   Interactions with DEX aggregator contracts (e.g., 1inch), which bundle trades across multiple liquidity sources.[^12]
*   Approval transactions granting DEX routers permission to spend their tokens.

The evolution of DEX protocols themselves, from the basic Automated Market Maker (AMM) model of Uniswap V2 to the concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers of Uniswap V3, reflects a growing sophistication among traders and a demand for greater capital efficiency.[^7] The emergence of DeFi aggregators further underscores this trend, catering to traders who seek optimal execution by sourcing liquidity from various platforms.[^12] This progression indicates that as the DeFi space matures, tools and protocols adapt to the increasingly complex strategies and efficiency requirements of their user base.

MEV searching represents a hyper-specialized trading behavior. While these users constitute a smaller segment, their on-chain actions, such as front-running, can significantly impact the trading experience for other DEX users by increasing slippage.[^11] This has, in turn, catalyzed innovation in MEV mitigation techniques (e.g., Flashbots) and solutions aimed at democratizing MEV capture, thereby influencing protocol design and the broader trading environment on Ethereum.[^2]

#### 2. Lenders & Borrowers

Lenders and borrowers form another significant cohort within DeFi, interacting with protocols like Aave and Compound to supply assets into lending pools to earn interest, or to borrow assets by providing collateral.[^1] These platforms have reinvented traditional financial services by adding programmable and decentralized features.[^2]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Calls to core lending protocol functions such as `supply()` (or `deposit()`), `borrow()`, `repay()`, and `withdraw()` on contracts like Aave's Pool or Compound's cToken contracts.[^13]
*   The minting of interest-bearing tokens (e.g., aTokens on Aave, cTokens on Compound) to the user's wallet upon supplying assets, and the burning of these tokens upon withdrawal.[^13]
*   Transactions related to liquidations, either as a liquidator executing a `liquidationCall()` or as a borrower whose position is being liquidated.[^15]
*   Setting or adjusting collateral status for supplied assets, for example, via Aave's `setUserUseReserveAsCollateral()`.[^15]

The behavior of lenders and borrowers is heavily shaped by the intrinsic design of these protocols. Mechanisms such as overcollateralization (requiring borrowers to supply more value than they borrow), dynamic interest rates based on utilization, and liquidation processes (whereby undercollateralized positions are closed by third-party liquidators incentivized by a bonus) create a specific risk-reward framework.[^15] Aave V3's introduction of features like "E-Mode" for correlated assets and "Isolation Mode" for riskier assets further refines this by offering tailored Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and borrowing capacities.[^13] Consequently, a user's decision-making process—regarding which assets to supply or borrow, how much leverage to take, and how diligently to monitor their position's health factor—is a strategic response to these embedded incentives and risk parameters.

A unique sub-segment within borrowing is the user of "Flash Loans," a feature pioneered by Aave.[^15] These are uncollateralized loans that must be repaid within the same Ethereum transaction block. Flash loan users are typically sophisticated developers or bots that leverage these atomic loans for complex operations such as arbitrage between DEXs, collateral swaps, or executing liquidations without needing upfront capital.[^16] This specialized behavior underscores DeFi's composability, where one protocol's feature becomes a powerful tool for interacting with others in a single, indivisible transaction.

#### 3. Liquidity Providers & Yield Farmers

Liquidity Providers (LPs) are users who supply pairs of assets to DEX liquidity pools, earning trading fees in return. Yield Farmers extend this activity by staking their LP tokens, or other DeFi assets, across various protocols to maximize their returns, often characterized by actively moving funds to chase the highest Annual Percentage Yields (APYs).[^2]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Invoking `addLiquidity()` or `addLiquidityETH()` functions on DEX router contracts (e.g., Uniswap V2/V3).[^8]
*   Receiving LP tokens (typically ERC-20 tokens representing their share of the pool).[^19]
*   Staking these LP tokens in yield farming contracts (often referred to as "MasterChef" style contracts or "gauges").
*   Frequent transactions involving the deposit and withdrawal of LP tokens or other staked assets across different DeFi protocols.
*   Claiming reward tokens from farming contracts.
*   Calling `removeLiquidity()` or `removeLiquidityETH()` to withdraw assets from pools and burn LP tokens.[^18]

Yield farming behavior is distinguished by a high velocity of capital and acute sensitivity to incentive structures. Yields are often most attractive at the inception of new farms or pools, leading to what is sometimes termed "liquidity locust" behavior, where users rapidly migrate capital to new, high-APY opportunities.[^21] This dynamic can create instability for protocols, which may experience sudden and significant inflows or outflows of liquidity as more lucrative options emerge elsewhere. Such capital flight is a direct consequence of the competitive and rapidly evolving landscape of yield farming incentives.

The inherent complexities of yield farming—including managing impermanent loss, assessing smart contract risks across multiple protocols, and optimizing multi-step strategies—have fostered a demand for specialized analytics and aggregation tools.[^12] Platforms like APY.vision help users track liquidity pool performance and impermanent loss[^23], while DeFi yield aggregators aim to automate the process of yield optimization.[^12] This indicates a spectrum of sophistication: some users act as passive LPs in a single pool, while more active yield farmers engage in complex, multi-protocol strategies, often relying on these advanced tools to navigate the landscape.

#### 4. Stakers (ETH Stakers, Liquid Stakers)

Stakers contribute to network security and consensus by locking up ETH. This can be done through solo staking (running a personal validator node, requiring 32 ETH) or, more commonly, through liquid staking protocols like Lido, which issue a tokenized, tradable representation of the staked ETH (e.g., stETH).[^5]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   **Solo Stakers:** Transactions sending exactly 32 ETH (or multiples thereof) to the official Ethereum deposit contract.[^25] While validator key generation is an off-chain preliminary step, the deposit transaction links these keys to the staked ETH. Subsequent on-chain activity includes validator attestations and block proposals on the consensus layer, though this is distinct from typical execution layer transactions.
*   **Liquid Stakers:** Calling `submit()` or similar staking functions on liquid staking protocol contracts (e.g., Lido's `Lido.sol` contract).[^24] Receiving liquid staking derivative tokens (e.g., stETH, rETH) in return. Transactions involving these derivative tokens, such as trading them on DEXs or using them as collateral in other DeFi protocols.[^27]

The advent of liquid staking protocols has dramatically lowered the barriers to ETH staking, both in terms of capital requirement (no 32 ETH minimum via pools) and technical expertise.[^5] This has given rise to a significant "liquid staker" segment. Their behavior is often a hybrid: they earn staking rewards while their staked capital, represented by the liquid staking token, remains active and composable within the broader DeFi ecosystem.[^24] This dynamic keeps a larger portion of ETH "liquid" and usable in DeFi, enhancing capital efficiency across the network, a stark contrast to the illiquidity of solo-staked ETH.

Validators, whether solo or part of a pool, earn rewards from two primary sources: consensus layer rewards (issuance for attestations and block proposals) and execution layer rewards (transaction priority fees/tips and MEV).[^5] While consensus rewards are relatively predictable, execution layer rewards, particularly MEV, can be optimized through sophisticated block construction strategies. This incentivizes larger or more technically adept staking operations to develop or employ advanced software to maximize MEV capture, potentially influencing validator behavior beyond simple protocol adherence and introducing considerations around centralization and fairness in MEV distribution.[^5]

#### 5. Stablecoin Users (Transactors, Savers)

Stablecoin users primarily interact with tokens designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT) or backed by a basket of crypto assets (e.g., DAI).[^1] They use stablecoins as a reliable store of value, a medium of exchange, a hedge against the volatility of other crypto assets, or as a fundamental unit of account within DeFi operations.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Frequent transfers of stablecoin tokens (e.g., ERC-20 transfers of USDC, USDT, DAI).
*   Holding significant balances of stablecoins in their wallets.
*   Utilizing stablecoins as one side of a trading pair in DEX swaps or when providing liquidity.
*   Interactions with stablecoin minting/redeeming mechanisms (e.g., depositing collateral into MakerDAO vaults to mint DAI[^1], or interacting with Circle/Tether associated contracts for USDC/USDT issuance/redemption via exchanges).
*   Depositing stablecoins into lending protocols to earn interest, or borrowing stablecoins against other crypto collateral.

The high transaction volume and widespread integration of stablecoins like USDC and USDT, which are among the most frequently called contracts on Ethereum[^4], underscore their critical role as foundational infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem.[^11] They function as the primary medium of exchange and unit of account for a vast range of on-chain financial activities, acting as a bridge to traditional financial value. Their stability and liquidity are paramount for the smooth operation of DEXs, lending markets, and yield farming strategies.

The choice of stablecoin can also offer insights into a user's risk tolerance and trust assumptions. Fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT rely on the transparency and reliability of centralized issuers and their attested reserves.[^2] Crypto-backed stablecoins like DAI depend on overcollateralization with other crypto assets and the robustness of their governing smart contract systems.[^1] Algorithmic stablecoins, though less prevalent after notable failures, rely on complex economic models to maintain their peg. A user predominantly transacting with USDC might prioritize perceived regulatory compliance and the backing of a known entity, whereas a DAI user might favor decentralization and on-chain transparency, accepting the associated smart contract and collateral volatility risks. This creates nuanced sub-segments even within the broad category of stablecoin users.

### B. The NFT & Metaverse Enthusiast

Engagement in the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and Metaverse sphere is driven by a diverse set of motivations, including collecting digital art and collectibles, financial speculation, social signaling through unique digital items, artistic expression, and the pursuit of immersive virtual experiences.[^2] User behavior in this domain is often event-driven, heavily influenced by new collection mints, game updates, community sentiment, and prevailing market trends.[^1]

#### 1. Collectors & Speculators

This group consists of users actively buying, selling, and trading NFTs on various marketplaces such as OpenSea and Blur.[^3] Collectors may acquire NFTs based on personal interest, artistic merit, or perceived long-term value, while speculators and "flippers" typically aim for short-term profits by capitalizing on price fluctuations and market hype.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Interactions with NFT marketplace smart contracts (e.g., OpenSea's Seaport protocol, Blur's exchange contract).[^29]
*   Frequent `OrderFulfilled` events (on Seaport) or `OrdersMatched`/`Trade` events (on Blur and similar marketplaces) in their transaction history.[^32]
*   Transfers of ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens, representing the NFTs themselves.
*   Approval transactions granting marketplace contracts permission to transfer their NFTs or spend their payment tokens (e.g., WETH, stablecoins).
*   A high frequency of buy and sell transactions, particularly for users engaged in flipping.
*   Participation in bidding processes on auction-style listings.

The evolution of NFT marketplaces, notably the emergence of platforms like Blur catering to "professional traders" with features such as zero trading fees (at times), advanced analytics, and token-based incentives, signals a maturation of the NFT market.[^29] This development suggests that a significant segment of NFT participants behaves more like financial traders than traditional hobbyist collectors, demanding tools optimized for speed, cost-efficiency, and in-depth market data. The success of such platforms indicates the substantial influence of this "pro-trader" archetype.

A specific speculative behavior observed is that of "sweepers," users who purchase multiple floor-priced NFTs from a particular collection in rapid succession.[^29] This activity, identifiable by a series of `fulfillOrder` (Seaport) or `execute` (Blur) calls for different token IDs from the same NFT contract within a short timeframe, is often aimed at capitalizing on perceived undervaluation, attempting to trigger upward price momentum by reducing the available floor supply, or farming marketplace rewards.

#### 2. Creators & Minters

Creators and minters are the individuals or teams who bring NFT collections to life. This process involves designing the digital assets, writing and deploying the underlying smart contracts (typically adhering to ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards), and managing the initial minting or sale event.[^3]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Deployment of new ERC-721 or ERC-1155 smart contracts. This is a "contract creation transaction" where an Externally Owned Account (EOA) sends a transaction with bytecode in the data field and no `to` address.[^6]
*   Invoking `mint()` or `safeMint()` functions on their deployed NFT contracts to issue new tokens to buyers or their own wallets.[^35]
*   Setting or updating metadata URIs (e.g., via `setBaseURI()` or `setTokenURI()`) which point to where the NFT's image and attributes are stored.[^35]
*   Configuring royalty parameters, either on-chain within the smart contract (if supported by standards like EIP-2981) or through marketplace settings.
*   Managing access control, such as granting or revoking "minter" roles within their contracts.[^35]

The choice of NFT standard and specific contract implementation by creators is a strategic decision that balances various factors. For instance, using ERC-721A can reduce gas costs for users minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction, potentially boosting participation in a primary sale, but it might lead to slightly higher gas costs for subsequent individual transfers.[^6] Similarly, decisions about using enumerable extensions (which increase gas for transfers but make on-chain tracking easier) or the specific minting functions (`_mint` vs. `_safeMint`) involve trade-offs between gas efficiency, security, and feature sets.[^6] These technical choices directly influence the user experience for both initial minters and secondary market participants, thereby impacting the overall lifecycle and trading dynamics of an NFT collection.

There is also an observable trend towards "creator-owned contracts," where artists and projects deploy their own unique smart contracts rather than using shared minting contracts provided by some marketplaces. This approach, while potentially involving more technical overhead, grants creators greater autonomy over their work, clearer provenance (as their address is the deployer), and more direct control over features like on-chain royalty enforcement and upgradeability.[^6] This signifies a desire among creators for deeper ownership of their digital presence and a more direct relationship with their collector base.[^3]

#### 3. NFT Gamers

NFT gamers are users who engage with blockchain-based games where in-game assets such as characters, items, land, or cards are represented as NFTs.[^2] Their on-chain activities revolve around acquiring, trading, and utilizing these NFTs within the specific game's ecosystem, often on specialized Layer 2 networks or sidechains to accommodate the high transaction throughput required for gaming.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Transactions on game-specific marketplaces (e.g., the Axie Infinity marketplace on the Ronin network, or Gods Unchained card trading on Immutable X).[^37]
*   Minting new game assets, such as breeding Axies in Axie Infinity, which involves interacting with a breeding contract and consuming utility tokens like Smooth Love Potion (SLP).[^39]
*   Transferring game NFTs between player wallets or to/from marketplace smart contracts.
*   Interacting with the game's utility token contracts (e.g., spending SLP for in-game actions, earning AXS governance tokens).[^39]
*   Staking game-related tokens for rewards or governance rights.
*   If the core game logic is itself on-chain (less common for complex games but a feature of some "fully on-chain games"), direct smart contract calls corresponding to gameplay actions.[^40]

The on-chain activity of NFT gamers is often closely tied to specific game loops and mechanics, such as the breeding cycle in Axie Infinity or card fusing and trading strategies in Gods Unchained.[^38] This can make their transaction patterns more cyclical and predictable compared to general NFT speculators. However, due to the high frequency and low individual value of many in-game transactions, these activities are predominantly conducted on Layer 2 solutions or sidechains like Ronin or Immutable X, which offer lower fees and faster confirmations than Ethereum's mainnet.[^28] Consequently, identifying an "NFT gamer" often requires analyzing their activity on these auxiliary networks, which are typically linked to their Ethereum L1 address.

The "Play-to-Earn" (P2E) model, integral to many NFT games, has cultivated a user segment whose primary motivation may be income generation rather than purely entertainment.[^28] This can lead to behaviors focused on optimizing earnings, such as participation in "scholarship" programs (where NFT owners lend assets to players for a share of their earnings, particularly prevalent in Axie Infinity) or intensive "grinding" for in-game rewards.[^39] The on-chain signature of such users might include frequent claiming of reward tokens and subsequent transfers to exchanges, or patterns consistent with operating as a scholar (i.e., playing with assets officially owned by another address but sharing in the rewards).

#### 4. Metaverse Inhabitants

Metaverse inhabitants are users who own, trade, or interact with assets within persistent virtual worlds built on blockchain technology, such as Decentraland.[^3] Key assets in these environments include virtual land parcels (often LAND NFTs) and avatar customizations in the form of wearables (also NFTs).[^42]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Transactions involving the specific NFT contracts for metaverse assets, such as Decentraland's LAND contract (ERC-721) or its various Wearable contracts (ERC-721 or ERC-1155).[^42]
*   Buying, selling, or minting LAND and Wearables on the native metaverse marketplace (e.g., Decentraland's marketplace, which operates on Polygon for newer assets) or on secondary marketplaces like OpenSea.[^42]
*   For creators, minting new Wearable collections.
*   Participating in DAO governance votes related to the metaverse platform, if they hold the platform's governance token (e.g., MANA for Decentraland) or governance-enabled assets like LAND.

The existence of metaverse assets across different networks (e.g., Decentraland's v1 wearables on Ethereum mainnet and v2 wearables on the Polygon network) can create a fragmented user experience.[^42] Users may need to manage assets and conduct transactions on both L1 and L2, complicating their on-chain footprint and potentially leading to assets being "stranded" or forgotten on one chain due to gas costs or complexity of bridging. This necessitates a multi-chain perspective when analyzing the behavior of metaverse inhabitants.

The value and trading activity of metaverse assets, particularly wearables, are often driven by factors such as rarity, their utility in social signaling and avatar expression, and participation in platform-specific events (e.g., airdrops associated with events like the Metaverse Fashion Week, MVFW).[^42] This suggests a strong socio-cultural component to the motivations of this user segment, where acquiring and displaying certain assets is tied to status, community engagement, and commemorating shared experiences, rather than purely functional or financial utility.

### C. The Governance Participant (DAO Members)

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are digitally native organizations governed by smart contracts and community consensus, often through token-based voting.[^34] DAO participants are users who engage with these structures, motivated by a desire to influence protocol development, manage communal treasuries, or benefit from the appreciation and utility of governance tokens.[^1]

#### 1. Voters & Proposal Interactors

These are users who actively shape DAO policies and actions by voting on formal proposals or, less frequently, by submitting proposals themselves. This direct participation is the hallmark of active governance.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Transactions interacting with DAO governance smart contracts (e.g., Compound's Governor Bravo, various custom DAO frameworks).
*   Calling specific governance functions such as `castVote()`, `propose()`, or `delegateVote()` (to assign their voting power to another address).
*   Holding a balance of the specific DAO's governance token(s), which is usually a prerequisite for voting.
*   Event logs such as `VoteCast`, `ProposalCreated`, and `VoteDelegated` being associated with their address.

Despite the democratic premise of DAOs, voter turnout is often low in many organizations. This implies that the "active governance participant" who regularly votes or proposes is a relatively small sub-segment of all governance token holders. Many token holders may be passive investors primarily interested in the token's financial performance or may lack the time, expertise, or motivation to engage deeply with governance proposals. This apathy can lead to decision-making power being concentrated among a smaller, more active group, posing challenges to the ideal of fully decentralized governance.

Delegation mechanisms are a common feature in many DAOs, allowing users to entrust their voting power to other, often more active or informed, community members. This creates an on-chain layer of "political representation," where a few delegates can wield significant influence by aggregating the votes of many individual token holders. The on-chain act of delegation (`delegateVote()`) is itself a distinct behavioral signature, differentiating passive delegators from both active individual voters and the influential delegates they empower.

#### 2. Governance Token Holders (Active vs. Passive)

This broader category includes all users who hold a DAO's governance tokens.[^34] "Active" holders might engage in off-chain discussions (e.g., on forums, Discord) that inform their on-chain voting, or they might be the delegates mentioned above. "Passive" holders, on the other hand, may primarily view the token as an investment or may have received it via an airdrop without a strong inclination to participate in governance processes.[^44]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Holding a non-zero balance of a specific DAO's governance token.
*   Acquisition of these tokens through DEX swaps, centralized exchange withdrawals, or airdrop claims.
*   For passive holders, a notable absence of voting or proposal interaction transactions, despite holding the tokens.
*   Staking governance tokens if the DAO offers such mechanisms for enhanced voting power, fee-sharing, or other rewards.

The initial distribution method of governance tokens—whether through broad-based airdrops to users, sales to venture capital firms, or allocations to the core team—profoundly influences the potential for decentralized governance from the outset. A highly concentrated initial distribution can predetermine power structures, potentially giving a few large entities de facto control or significant sway over proposals, regardless of the voting activity of smaller, individual holders. Analyzing the on-chain distribution of governance tokens (e.g., identifying top holders) is therefore crucial for understanding the true decentralization level of a DAO and contextualizing the effective power of any individual governance token holder.

### D. The Blockchain Gamer (Beyond NFT-Specific Interactions)

While NFT gamers focus on asset ownership and trading, a more deeply integrated "blockchain gamer" interacts with game logic and progression systems that are themselves embedded within smart contracts. This often occurs on Layer 2 solutions or sidechains to ensure performance and affordability. Their on-chain activity is a direct reflection of gameplay actions and Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics, representing a more profound utilization of blockchain technology than merely owning NFT assets.[^40]

#### 1. Users Interacting with On-Chain Game Logic and P2E Mechanics

These are players whose in-game actions—such as completing quests, winning battles, crafting items, or leveling up—are recorded as blockchain transactions or trigger state changes in the game's smart contracts.[^40] A significant aspect of this interaction is often the earning of in-game currencies or utility tokens through P2E mechanisms.[^28]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Frequent, often small-value, transactions directed to game-specific smart contracts that represent discrete game actions (if the game logic is indeed on-chain).
*   Receiving P2E reward tokens (e.g., SLP in Axie Infinity) into their wallets as a result of gameplay.[^39]
*   Staking or swapping these earned P2E reward tokens on DEXs or within the game's ecosystem.
*   A high volume of activity on the specific L2 or sidechain where the game predominantly operates (e.g., Ronin for Axie Infinity, Immutable X for Gods Unchained).

The archetype of the true "on-chain gamer," whose every significant action is a blockchain transaction, is arguably rarer than that of the "NFT gamer" who primarily owns and trades game-related NFTs. Developing fully on-chain games is technically demanding, and such games can struggle with user experience due to gas costs and transaction latency if not deployed on highly optimized L2s or application-specific sidechains.[^41] Therefore, users genuinely interacting with extensive on-chain game logic are most likely found on these specialized networks. Their on-chain behavior—characterized by frequent, small, game-action-oriented transactions—serves as a practical test for the scalability and viability of blockchain technology in supporting complex, real-time consumer applications beyond simpler financial transactions or asset transfers.

The inherent composability of on-chain games, where game logic and state are publicly accessible via smart contracts, opens up possibilities for emergent user behaviors.[^40] Technically proficient players or third-party developers could build custom tools, alternative game frontends, or even entirely new game modes that interact directly with the original game's public smart contracts. This could foster an on-chain "modding" community, creating a unique type of "meta-gamer" or "on-chain game developer/modder" whose interactions are with the game's contracts but for purposes extending beyond typical play.

### E. The Cross-Chain & Scalability Seeker

This category encompasses users who actively navigate Ethereum's expanding multi-chain landscape. They are driven by the need for lower transaction fees, faster confirmation times, access to dApps or assets available on other networks, or to leverage specific functionalities of Layer 2 solutions. Their behavior involves making trust assumptions regarding the security of bridges and L2 protocols and often requires a working understanding of cross-chain interaction mechanics.[^41]

#### 1. Bridge Users

Bridge users are those who transfer assets between Ethereum L1 and various L2s (such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon PoS) or other independent L1 blockchains. They utilize bridge protocols that facilitate these cross-network asset movements, often employing mechanisms like "lock-and-mint" for deposits or "burn-and-prove" for withdrawals.[^48]

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Interactions with bridge smart contracts on Ethereum L1 (e.g., depositing ETH or ERC-20 tokens into the Polygon PoS bridge contract or an L2's canonical bridge contract).[^48]
*   On the source chain: transactions that lock assets in the bridge contract or burn wrapped versions of assets. Event logs might include `TokensLocked` or `TokensBurned`.
*   On the destination chain: transactions receiving assets from the bridge contract (minting wrapped assets or releasing native assets). Event logs might include `TokensMinted` or `TokensReleased`.
*   Transactions that often involve two distinct steps on different chains, especially for withdrawals which may require a claim transaction after a waiting period.[^48]
*   Use of third-party bridge aggregator protocols that find optimal routes for cross-chain transfers.[^50]
*   The `bridges_used` field in Nansen's Address Stats can also identify such users.[^51]

The flow of assets through bridges serves as a strong indicator of user sentiment regarding the attractiveness and utility of L2 solutions versus L1 or between different blockchain ecosystems. A predominant one-way flow from L1 to a specific L2, as was observed from Ethereum to Polygon, suggests users perceive greater opportunities or a better user experience on that L2.[^48] Conversely, reversals in these flows, such as the temporary shift back to Ethereum around the time of the Merge, can signal reactions to significant network events or changes in perceived risk/reward profiles.[^48] Thus, aggregate bridge usage patterns offer a valuable macroeconomic lens on the multi-chain landscape.

However, the "Bridge User" category is not uniform. The complexities, potential delays, and security risks associated with bridge mechanisms—such as multi-step withdrawal processes that can lead to users forgetting to claim their assets or the significant financial losses from bridge exploits—mean that users approach bridging with varying levels of understanding and caution.[^48] Sophisticated users may navigate these intricacies more effectively, employing tools to track cross-chain transactions and carefully assessing bridge security. Less experienced users, on the other hand, might be more prone to errors, loss of funds due to forgotten claims, or falling victim to less secure bridge protocols. This highlights a critical need for improved user experience and security standards in cross-chain interactions.

#### 2. Layer 2 Adopters

Layer 2 adopters are users who conduct a significant portion of their Ethereum-related activities on L2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon PoS, or newer ZK-rollups. Their primary motivation is to benefit from the lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times offered by these networks while often still leveraging the underlying security of Ethereum L1.[^41]

**On-chain Signatures** (primarily on L2 networks, but attributable to an Ethereum user via their consistent address):

*   A high frequency of transactions on specific L2 networks.
*   Interactions with dApps (DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, games) that are deployed on these L2s.[^28]
*   Holding L2-native tokens or bridged versions of L1 assets within their L2 wallets.
*   Transactions involving the L2's canonical bridge contracts for depositing assets from L1 or withdrawing assets back to L1.
*   Transactions related to L2-specific functionalities, such as interacting with L2 sequencers or data availability layers (e.g., blob data submissions for rollups).[^11]

The specific Layer 2 solution a user predominantly adopts can reflect their implicit or explicit prioritization of various factors. For instance, a user might choose Arbitrum for its mature dApp ecosystem and the Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM)[^52], while another might opt for a ZK-rollup due to a preference for the security model of validity proofs over the fraud proofs used by optimistic rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum.[^47] EVM compatibility or equivalence is also a significant factor, as it allows developers to easily migrate existing Ethereum dApps and users to leverage familiar tools and interfaces.[^52]

A noteworthy trend is the potential emergence of "L2 Native Users." These are individuals who primarily onboard and operate within a specific L2 ecosystem, with minimal direct interaction with Ethereum L1. This becomes increasingly feasible as L2s develop robust fiat on-ramps and cultivate self-contained, vibrant ecosystems of dApps.[^47] In such a scenario, the user's primary blockchain experience is L2-centric, with L1 Ethereum serving mainly as a settlement and security layer that operates in the background. This evolution could reshape the definition of an "Ethereum user" in a progressively multi-layered blockchain architecture.

### F. Emerging & Specialized User Categories

Beyond the more established archetypes, the Ethereum ecosystem continually fosters new and specialized user behaviors driven by innovation in protocol design and market dynamics.

#### 1. Airdrop Hunters

Airdrop hunters are users who strategically interact with a multitude of protocols, particularly new or pre-token projects, with the primary objective of qualifying for potential future distributions (airdrops) of governance or utility tokens.[^45] This behavior is often characterized by broad, sometimes superficial, engagement across many dApps to meet anticipated eligibility criteria.

**On-chain Signatures:**

*   Interactions with a diverse range of smart contracts, often shortly after protocol launch or announcement.
*   A pattern of small, distinct interactions (e.g., a single swap, one lending action, a minimal NFT mint) across numerous dApps.
*   Funding patterns that may indicate Sybil activity, such as multiple addresses being funded from a common source wallet, or funds being fanned out and later consolidated to a few addresses after claiming airdrops.[^55]
*   Execution of specific transaction sequences or interaction with particular features known or rumored to be part of an airdrop's eligibility criteria (e.g., sequential bridging, specific volume thresholds).[^55]
*   Claiming airdropped tokens from multiple distinct distributor smart contracts.
*   Often, a rapid sale of claimed airdropped tokens on DEXs shortly after receipt.
