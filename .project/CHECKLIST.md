**KEY:**
*   `[x]` - Appears substantially done or well underway based on provided files.
*   `[p]` - Partially done, or a clear foundation/intent is visible.
*   `[ ]` - No clear evidence in the provided files.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Initial Data Extraction (Baseline)

**Objective:** Establish core data pipeline, validate initial contract map, and extract basic interaction data.

### 1.1. Project Initialization & Scope Refinement
- [x] **Define Core Objectives:**
    - [x] Clearly articulate definitions for "Behavior" (interaction patterns, sequential dynamics, financial magnitude, network characteristics). *(Evident in `User-Archetype-Report.md`)*
    - [p] Clearly articulate definitions for "Revenue" (trading profits, MEV, LP fees, lending interest, staking, yield farming, airdrops). Differentiate active vs. passive. *(Initial REV calculation focuses on tx fees. Broader revenue definitions are in the plan but not yet implemented in code.)*
- [x] **Define Scope:**
    - [x] Finalize historical time range for analysis (e.g., last 12-24 months). *(Handled by `PipelineConfig` with `MAX_DAYS_LOOKBACK`)*
    - [x] Confirm initial focus on Ethereum mainnet. *(Implicit throughout, `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum`)*
    - [x] Outline strategy for incorporating `transactions`, `logs`, and `traces` tables. *(Current interaction ETL uses `transactions` table with full contract map. Plan discusses `logs` and `traces` extensively for Phase 2.)*
- [x] **Establish BigQuery Cost Management:**
    - [x] Configure `CostAwareBigQueryClient` with appropriate limits. *(Implemented in `cost_aware_client.py` and `config.py`)*
    - [x] Implement procedures for query cost estimation (dry runs). *(Implemented in `cost_aware_client.py`)*
    - [ ] Set up project/user-level billing alerts in GCP. *(External to codebase, assumed)*
- [x] **Setup Version Control & Project Structure:**
    - [x] Ensure all code, configurations, and maps are in Git. *(Implied by `.gitignore` and project structure)*
    - [x] Organize project directories for data, scripts, notebooks, etc. *(Structure is evident)*

### 1.2. `defi_contract_map.json` - Initial Version & Validation
- [x] **Load Existing `defi_contract_map.json`:** Programmatically parse the current map. *(Implemented in `interaction_etl.py` with `load_contract_map()` function)*
- [p] **Initial Validation:**
    - [p] Cross-reference a sample of existing contract addresses with Etherscan tags. *(`defi_contract_map.json` has "etherscan_verified": "Yes" and "first_block", suggesting some validation)*
    - [p] Cross-reference with external sources (e.g., DeFi Llama, official docs) for a sample. *(`Address-Mapping.md` mentions this methodology)*
- [x] **Define Initial Contract Categories/Sub-categories:** Ensure they are sufficient for Phase 1 analysis. *(`defi_contract_map.json` has a detailed structure with user_type, protocol_category, contract_role)*
- [x] **Document Validation Process & Sources.** *(Present in `Address-Mapping.md`)*

### 1.3. Basic Interaction Data Extraction (BigQuery)
- [x] **Develop Initial SQL Queries:**

    - [ ] Query `logs` table: `logs.address` IN (contracts from `defi_contract_map.json`), then join to `transactions` to get `from_address`. *(Planned for Phase 2)*
    - [x] Ensure mandatory `block_timestamp` filtering in all queries. *(Implemented with date range filtering)*
- [x] **Implement Python Script for Query Execution:**
    - [x] Use `CostAwareBigQueryClient`. *(Used in `interaction_etl.py` main() function)*
    - [x] Implement caching for query results (`QueryCache`). *(Used in `interaction_etl.py` main() function)*
- [x] **Extract Initial Interaction Dataset:**
    - [x] Output: `user_address`, `interacted_contract_address`, `timestamp`, `transaction_hash`, `source_table` (transactions/logs). *(Implemented: outputs `from_address`, `to_address`, `block_timestamp`, `transaction_hash`, plus gas and value data)*
- [x] **Store Extracted Data:** (e.g., Parquet files locally or in cloud storage). *(Implemented with `save_dataframe_safely()` function saving to Parquet)*

### 1.4. Basic Feature Engineering & EDA
- [x] **Map Interactions to Contract Categories:** Add `contract_group` from `defi_contract_map.json` to the interaction dataset. *(Implemented with `enrich_interactions_with_metadata()` function adding user_type, protocol_category, contract_role, etc.)*
- [x] **Develop Basic Features:**
